This file has minimal obfuscation that should not trigger the rule.

Just a few unicode characters: café naïve résumé

Some Base64 but not enough: SGVsbG8=

A single upside down character: ɐ

This should NOT trigger because it doesn't meet the threshold requirements:
- Not enough Unicode obfuscation types (need 2+)
- Not enough encoding patterns (need 2+) 
- No steganography
- No obfuscation functions
