This is a plain text file with no obfuscation.

It contains regular English text with normal punctuation and formatting.
There are no Unicode substitutions, no encoded content, and no steganography.

Just normal words like: hello, world, message, secret, hidden.
Some numbers: 123456789
Some symbols: !@#$%^&*()

This should NOT trigger the YARA rule because it contains no actual obfuscated text outcomes.
