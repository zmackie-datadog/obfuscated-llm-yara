Edge case testing with truly minimal content:

Single character obfuscation: ɐ (one upside down char)
Two characters: ᚺᛖ (two runes)
Mixed with normal: Hello ⠓⠑ World (just two braille chars)
Partial base64: SGVs (too short)
Almost morse: ... . but not quite
Small leetspeak: h3y (minimal)

This should NOT trigger because these are truly minimal amounts.
