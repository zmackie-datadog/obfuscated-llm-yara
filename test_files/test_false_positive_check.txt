This file tests for false positives - things that look like obfuscation but aren't:

Some accented characters: café naïve résumé façade

A few dots and dashes: - .. - but not Morse code

Some numbers and letters: A1B2C3D4 but not real encoding

Short hex-like strings: AB CD EF but too short to be real encoding

Normal punctuation: !@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':",./<>?

Foreign language text: Здравствуй мир (Russian)
Another language: مرحبا بالعالم (Arabic)

This should NOT trigger because these aren't actual obfuscation outcomes.
