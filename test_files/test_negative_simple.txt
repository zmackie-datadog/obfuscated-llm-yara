This is a simple text file with normal content.

It contains regular ASCII text without any obfuscation techniques.
There are no Unicode substitutions, no steganography, and no encoding patterns.

This file should NOT trigger the YARA rule because it lacks the required 
obfuscation patterns.

Just plain English text here.
Some numbers: 123456789
Some punctuation: !@#$%^&*()
But nothing that would indicate text obfuscation techniques.
